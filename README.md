`Project: Matching ard Game`


This is a project that uses javascript to create a classic Matching Card Game.  All credit to the images goes to the good artists at deviant art and the idea comes from my coding sensei Leon Noel.  The actual name of the game is The Elemental Match (I know the name is perfect). So lets get deeper into 


`---The Elemental Match---`

`I USED`
`-HTML, CSS, JavaScript-`
 

This project started off simple (as they always do).  I created a div as a board and filled it with small image filled sections to be the cards. Each card has the same image and, using click events and js, we give it the illusion of a card flip! You click the main card image (aka the back of the card) and it revels another image (aka the front of the card). Voila. I call the function flipEm cause you feel like youre flipping a table in a bar fight when you click one of these cards.  After that flipping comes the matching and after the matching comes a counter function to let you know how bad your memory is. Finally, I dressed it all up with some css to make you feel like you're some spacebound wizard enjoying your favorite pastime

Its all pretty standard stuff but creating it was a good way to practice js and it made me think more like a programmer.  As a software engineer you create the rules of engagement for your creations, but you also interpret the rules of reality in your creations. I might not know how to make a flipping multisided image yet, but I am able to use js to give a user the illusion of a card being flipped.  I enjoy the process of interpreting things differently and creating things from this new perspective
